# CoffeeShop App

## What it does:

This Android application allows users to:

* Order various types of drinks and food.
* Save favorite drinks and food items for quick reordering.
* View their order history with date and time for easy reordering.
* Navigate seamlessly between different sections of the app.

## What it is:

An Android mobile application developed using Kotlin.

## Technologies Used:

* **[Kotlin:](https://kotlinlang.org/)** Primary programming language. 
* **[Room Database:](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)** For local data storage.
* **[MVVM Architecture:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm)** For clean separation of concerns and improved testability. 
* **[Jetpack Navigation Components:](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation)** For seamless navigation between app screens.
* **[ViewModel & LiveData:](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)** For managing UI state and data across different parts of the application. 
* **[Kotlin Coroutines:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines/)** For asynchronous operations like network requests and database interactions.

## Ambition:

This project was developed to gain practical experience with key Android development technologies and best practices, including:

* **Modern Android development with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.**
* **Data persistence using Room Database and SharedPreferences.**
* **Network requests and data handling with Ktor.**
* **User authentication and authorization.**
* **Implementing basic UI/UX design principles.**

## Current Stage:

This project is currently **completed** and includes all the core features mentioned above.

I hope this README provides a clear and concise overview of the CoffeeShop App!
